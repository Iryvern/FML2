The research paper is slightly behind the code, the code is now clustering based on accuracy which was the original goal, the research paper uses weights and biases with cosine and kmneas instead.
The reason for the weights and biases was because the code also supoported anomaly detection models besides classification ones, that part still has to be updated.
